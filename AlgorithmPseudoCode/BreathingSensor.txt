This may seem confusing but I can explain it to you guys later. We can use this algorithm to measure at what speed the person is breathing.

Create an array (lets call it fsr) with 100 (or (time interval in ms)/(delay in ms between each response)) indexes 
Since the sensor provides data at a fixed frequency, this array measures a fixed amount of time (5 second if using the calculation above).

int i = 0;

int totalIndexes = 100;

Code in loop which is repeatedly called to get data from sensors
-------------------
// Store data into array until we have enough data for analysis
fsr[i%totalIndexes] = dataFromSensor()
if(i%totalIndexes==(totalIndexes-1))
	analyzeData()
i++
-------------------

function analyzeData()

// Calc average
int total = 0;
	for(int ind = 0; ind < totalIndexes; ind++)
		total += fsr[ind];
int average = total/totalIndexes;

// Calc if wave starts from above
boolean above = (fsr[0] > average);

// variable to store breathing speed
breath= 0;

// store what the last index was when a breath was counted so that we don't count breaths too frequently
int lastChangeIndex = 0;

// Loop through array
	for(int ind = 0; ind < totalIndexes; ind++)
	{
		// If the current index crosses the average and the last counted breath was not very recent, count a breath
		if(((above && fsr[ind] < average) || (!above && fsr[ind] > average) ) && lastChangeIndex < (ind-4)%totalIndexes)
		{
			breath++;
			above != above;
		}
	}
